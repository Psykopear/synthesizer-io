# ReDaw

This is a project to learn the architectural problems that can arise in building a digital audio workstation for music production.

It's not meant to become a complete project, but rather a proof of concept with "minimal" dependencies.
The only dependencies are [cpal]() to interface with audio hardware, [druid]() for the gui and [time_calc]() to handle musical time.

It starts as a fork of [raphlinus's synthesizer-io](https://github.com/raphlinus/synthesizer-io),
but I only use the 'synthesizer-io-core' crate with some work on top to make it fit this use case.

Nothing really interesting to see here yet...
